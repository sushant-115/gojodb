# **GojoDB \- A Universal, Horizontally Scalable Database**

GojoDB is an ambitious project to build a universal database designed for extreme extensibility, horizontal scalability, and robust resource management. It aims to provide high availability and fault tolerance for modern data-intensive applications.

## **Goals**

The primary goals for GojoDB are:

* **Universal Applicability:** Serve a wide range of data storage and retrieval needs.  
* **Horizontal Scalability:** All components, including ingestors, queriers, control plane, and storage engine, are designed to scale out.  
* **Granular Resource Management:**  
  * **Per-Query Control:** Implement mechanisms for managing resources consumed by individual queries, including query prioritization, throttling, and admission control to prevent system overload.  
  * **User-Level Quotas:** Enforce resource quotas (e.g., storage, compute, request rates) for different users or tenants to ensure fair usage and prevent abuse.  (Work in progress)
* **High Availability:** Eliminate single points of failure and ensure continuous operation.  
* **Sharding:** Automatic data distribution across multiple nodes for performance and capacity.  
* **Persistence:** Durable storage of data.  
* **Security:** Robust security mechanisms including encryption and access control.  (Work in progress)
* **Encryption:** Support for data encryption at rest and in transit.  (Work in progress)
* **GraphQL Support:** Native support for GraphQL queries.  
* **Data Lifecycle Management:**  (Work in progress)
  * **Archival:** Mechanisms for moving data to cold storage.  
  * **Restore:** Reliable data restoration capabilities.  
* **External Storage Integration:** Support for reading data from object stores like S3.  (Work in progress)
* **Fault Tolerance:** Resilience against network partitions and node failures, potentially leveraging mechanisms like 3-Phase Commit for critical operations.

## **High-Level Design**

GojoDB's architecture is based on a distributed, microservice-oriented approach:

* **Storage Tiers:**  
  * **Hot Storage:** Utilizes shared file systems like AWS EFS or GCP Filestore for fast access to frequently used data.  
  * **Cold Storage:** Leverages object storage solutions like AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage for cost-effective long-term archival.  
* **Control Plane (**gojodb\_controller**):**  
  * Manages cluster state, node discovery, leader election, and resource scheduling.  
  * **Centralized Resource Management Logic:** Coordinates and enforces resource limits, user quotas, and query admission control policies across the cluster.  
  * Designed for high availability using distributed consensus (e.g., Raft).  
* **API Microservices:**  
  * **Indexed Reads/Quick Reads Service:** Handles optimized read operations, subject to resource controls.  
  * **Indexed Updates/Quick Writes Service:** Manages fast write operations, subject to resource controls.  
  * **Bulk Writes Service:** Optimized for ingesting large volumes of data, with appropriate resource allocation.  
  * **Aggregation Service:** Performs aggregation jobs on data from both hot and cold storage, with resource governance.  
  * **GraphQL Service:** Provides a GraphQL interface to the database, integrated with resource management.  
* **Data Sharding & Replication:** Data is sharded across multiple storage nodes, and each shard is replicated for fault tolerance.  
* **Commit Protocol:** Aims to implement robust commit protocols (like 3-Phase Commit) for distributed transactions to prevent issues like split-brain during network partitions.  
* **Resource Enforcement Points:** Query execution engines and API gateways will act as enforcement points for the policies defined by the control plane.

## **Key Features (Planned)**

* Distributed Query Processing with Resource Awareness  
* Pluggable Storage Engine Adapters  
* User-Defined Functions  
* Real-time Data Ingestion  
* Comprehensive Monitoring and Alerting (including resource usage)  
* Command-Line Interface (CLI) for administration (including resource configuration)  
* Client SDKs for various programming languages  
* Query Throttling and Admission Control  
* User and Tenant Resource Quotas
